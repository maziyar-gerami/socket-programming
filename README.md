# Java Socket Programming

## Overview

This project focuses on socket programming using Java, a powerful programming language for building networked applications. Socket programming allows the creation of client-server applications, facilitating communication over the network. This README.md provides an overview of the project and its key components.

## Project Description

In this project, we explore the world of network programming using Java sockets. We create both client and server applications that can exchange data over the network. These applications can be used for various purposes, including chat applications, file transfers, and more.

## Key Features

- Client-Server Communication**: The project demonstrates how to establish a connection between a client and a server using sockets. It showcases two-way communication, allowing data to flow seamlessly between the two.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `client`: Contains the Java client application code.
- `server`: Contains the Java server application code.
- `shared`: Includes shared resources or classes used by both the client and server.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `client` and `server` directories.
3. Compile the Java code using the Java compiler (`javac`).
4. Run the server application on one machine.
5. Run the client application on another machine, specifying the server's IP address and port.
6. Begin communicating between the client and server applications.
